    "    \"The structure of a SWNT can be conceptualized by wrapping a one-atom-thick layer of graphite called graphene into a seamless cylinder. The way the graphene sheet is wrapped is represented by a pair of indices (n,m). The integers n and m denote the number of unit vectors along two directions in the honeycomb crystal lattice of graphene. If m = 0, the nanotubes are called zigzag nanotubes, and if n = m, the nanotubes are called armchair nanotubes. Otherwise, they are called chiral.\" (Source <a target=\"_tab\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube#Single-walled\">Wikipedia</a>).\n",

    "    Because of the symmetry and unique electronic structure of graphene, the structure of a nanotube strongly affects its electrical properties. For a given (n,m) nanotube, if n = m, the nanotube is metallic; if n − m is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate semiconductor. Thus all armchair (n = m) nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting. This $(n-m=3j)$ rule is of geometrical nature and can be easily understood by means of the band folding approximation. Neglecting the impact of the curvature, a carbon nanotube can be pictured as a planar portion of graphene with periodic boundary condition applied perpendicular to the axe of the tube. The consequence of the applied periodic boundary condition is that the component of the wavevector in that direction is quantized. Only given velues of $\\vec{k}_{perp}$ are compatible with the CNT structure.

    "The band structure of carbon nanotubes having certain (n, m) indexes can be easily calculated.[13] A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range.[14] The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n, m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10, 1) and (8, 3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but the latter is a semiconductor.\n",
